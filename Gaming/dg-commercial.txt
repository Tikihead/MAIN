Tuvor glances around.

Tuvor furrows his brow.

Tuvor picks up a piece of parchment.

Close up of the parchment reveals it to be a birth certificate, the name standing out: Kissinda Trionomes.

Tuvor gasps!

Cut to the office in the Odarian temple, you see two people making out across Rev's desk.

Someone giggles.

Someone moans.

A brassiere flies across the screen, catching and hanging on a portrait on the wall.

Rev just entered from the east.

Rev gapes.

Someone gasps.

Someone shrieks!

Cut to Landoo, Kissinda, and Renshi standing around Town Square

Landoo nods to Kissinda apologetically.

Kissinda says, "But Landoo, We were supposed to have khits together! How could you do this to me! Whatever shall I do?"

Kissinda raises her hand biting her knuckle.

Landoo shrugs helplessly.

Kissinda glances to Renshi, their eyes meeting lingeringly.

Renshi grins a devilishly handsome if somewhat evil grin.

You hear the voice of Mestoffa say, "Tune in next time to find out what Tuvor does with the secret he's learned, how Rev handles a wicked display of worship, and if Kissinda can survive through yet another lost love on, As Dragon's Gate Turns."

Panoramic shot of a large audience of Spurians, laughing. Cut shot to the stage, where Tulipe stands before a short podium, a watermelon planted squarely in the center.

Tulipe shouts, "Sometimes you gotta just say ....Wham!"

Tulipe swings her two-handed steelwood maul at the watermelon.
        The attack is a critical blow to the torso!
        The watermelon shatters into tiny bits and chunks!

The audience shrieks in unison, the front rows raising their hands, covering themselves with large see-through plastic sheets as the watermelon splatters all over.

Oake laughs

Vixen standing on a street corner, opening a small package and slowly slipping something into her mouth. A breeze picks up and blows her hair around seductively and she smiles temptingly.

Changeman glances.

Grachus glances.

Felixim glances.

Oake yawns cutely.

Oake ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Oake stands up and turns off the television.

Oake just went through an open door.

-----

The television begins glowing an odd, green color. Misty fog begins tumbling through the screen, spilling out across the floor. Moloch appears in the screen.

Moloch quickly casts his gaze across the room.

Moloch just entered through a small gap in the television screen.

Moloch laughs maniacally.
***************************************

Sordum, Alynia, and Stanrar wander into the room and find the TV left unattended. Alynia shoos the raven away from the remote and it flies out the window. Stanrar and Sordum sit on the couch and Alynia sits on the floor in front of the TV with her legs crossed.

Sordum says, "Lets see what’s on, shall we?"

Sordum hums to himself as he fiddles with the propeller hat on his head.

Stanrar nods up and down.

Alynia giggles as she gestures the remote towards the screen and pushes a button.
